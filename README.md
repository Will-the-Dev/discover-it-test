# Getting Started

### npm install or yarn && yarn start

## Build and run on node JS server

### yarn build && yarn postbuild or yarn startprod

## Note: The choice of using some Material UI here

-   material ui is to some extent styled
-   it is a technical test and creating all the components from scratch might take some time
-   Very well know ui library for react projects

## Typescript - because I mean :) => I really can preach about this

Can better explain myself further on this

## Testing - jest/ts-jest

-   commonly known and used
-   simple to implement
